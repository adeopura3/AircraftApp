Aircraft application

User Operations

- Boot: Initializes the system

- Enqueue: Enqueues the aircraft in the system. The user can specify the type of the aircraft and the size of the aircraft.

- Dequeue: Dequeues the highest priority item from the queue. Passenger aircraft are higher priority than Cargo. Large are higher proprity than small. After priorities, follow FIFO.

Algorithms

- Enqueue: Add in sorted order. Linear O(N)

- Dequeue: Remove the first element from the queue

High level Code organization

- Routes (routes.js)
    - Route to home page, where the user is required to boot the system
    - Route to the aircraftControlSystemAndStatus page where the user can enqueue, dequeue, and view the aircrafts in the system
    - If the user were to directly try to access aircraftControlSystemAndStatus page and the system were not booted, they will be redirected to the home page
    
- Controllers (controllers.js)
    -
