Aircraft application

User Operations

- Boot: Initializes the system

- Enqueue: Enqueues the aircraft in the system. The user can specify the type of the aircraft and the size of the aircraft.

- Dequeue: Dequeues the highest priority item from the queue. Passenger aircraft are higher priority than Cargo. Large are higher proprity than small. After priorities, follow FIFO.

Algorithms

- Enqueue: Add in sorted order. Linear O(N)

- Dequeue: Remove the first element from the queue

High level Code organization

- Home Page
    - Route in the routes.js
    - Uses the template home.html
        - Provides a button that the user can use to initialize the system
    - Controller in controller.js
        - Makes use of the Angular location service
        - Makes use of a custom systemBootService
        - Handles the click from the boot system button and redirects to the airTrafficControlAndStatus route
   
        

- Air Traffic Contorl and Status Page
    - Route in routes.js
    - Uses the template airTrafficControlAndStatus.html
    - Controller in controller.js
        - If the page was accessed without the system boot, redirects to the system boot page
        - 
    - Route to home page, where the user is required to boot the system
    - Route to the aircraftControlSystemAndStatus page where the user can enqueue, dequeue, and view the aircrafts in the system
    - If the user were to directly try to access aircraftControlSystemAndStatus page and the system were not booted, they will be redirected to the home page
    
- Controllers (controllers.js)
    - There is a controller for the home page that handles the system boot
        - 
    - There is a controller for the aircraftControlSystemAndStatus page that handles
        - enqueue
        - dequeue
        -
